Recommended AWS Tech Stack for Strategy Automation
This document outlines a cost-effective, reliable, and low-maintenance technology stack on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for automating your Python-based trading strategy.

1. The Recommended Tech Stack
The core principle is to use a "serverless" approach, which means you don't have to manage any virtual machines. AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, and you only pay for the execution time of your scripts.

Component

AWS Service

Purpose & Rationale

Compute

AWS Lambda

This is where your Python scripts will run. Lambda is a serverless compute service that executes your code in response to events. It's perfect for this task because it's highly cost-effective (with a generous free tier that might cover all your usage) and requires zero server maintenance.

Scheduling

Amazon EventBridge

This is your automated scheduler or "cron job." You will configure EventBridge to trigger your Lambda function on a fixed schedule (e.g., every trading day at 5:00 PM IST) to start the data scraping and trade execution process.

Data Storage

Amazon S3

This is a highly durable and inexpensive object storage service. All of your project's data files (historical_data, data/processed, nifty200.csv, log files, etc.) will be stored here instead of on a local filesystem. This decouples your data from your code, making the system more robust.

Notifications

Amazon SNS

This is a simple notification service. Your script can be configured to send a message (e.g., an email or SMS) via SNS at the end of its run. This is crucial for oversight, providing a simple "System OK" or "System FAILED" message each day.

Security

AWS Secrets Manager

This service allows you to securely store and manage your Fyers API credentials (Client ID, Secret Key, etc.). Your script will fetch these credentials at runtime instead of storing them in a plain text config.py file, which is a critical security best practice.

2. The Automated Workflow
Here is how these services will work together in a fully automated daily cycle:

Trigger (5:00 PM IST): An Amazon EventBridge rule fires on its schedule.

Execution: EventBridge invokes your primary AWS Lambda function.

Data & Config Loading:

The Lambda function starts.

It securely retrieves the Fyers API credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.

It reads the nifty200.csv and any existing historical data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

Data Pipeline:

The script runs the data scraper logic to fetch the latest daily prices from the Fyers API.

It runs the indicator calculation logic.

It saves the updated data files back to the Amazon S3 bucket.

Strategy Execution:

The script runs the final_backtester logic.

It determines if any new trades should be entered or existing trades should be exited.

It connects to the Fyers API to place the necessary buy or sell orders for the next trading day.

Notification:

At the end of the run, the script sends a status message to an Amazon SNS topic.

SNS then sends you an email with a summary, such as: "Execution successful. 1 new trade placed for RELIANCE. 2 positions closed." or "Execution FAILED: [Error Message]".

3. Why This Stack is Recommended
Extremely Cost-Effective: With AWS Lambda's free tier (1 million free requests per month) and S3's low storage costs, it's highly likely that running this entire system will cost you less than a few dollars per month, if not free.

Highly Reliable & Scalable: These are managed AWS services, meaning they are inherently fault-tolerant and can handle the workload without any issues.

Zero Maintenance: The "serverless" nature of this stack means you never have to worry about patching an operating system, managing server uptime, or handling infrastructure. You can truly "set it and forget it."

Secure: By using AWS Secrets Manager, your sensitive API credentials are never exposed in your code, which is a major security advantage.

This tech stack provides a professional-grade, robust, and cost-effective foundation for moving your strategy from research into fully automated live execution.
