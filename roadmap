Strategic Roadmap: Nifty 200 Pullback System
This roadmap outlines the sequential phases to enhance the backtester, improve its performance (CAGR), and reduce its drawdowns.

Phase 0: Fortify the Foundation (Completed)
Objective: Establish a truthful performance baseline by correcting for optimistic assumptions.

[x] Implement High-Fidelity Slippage Model: Integrate the multi-factor dynamic slippage function.

[x] Re-run and Re-baseline: Execute the backtester with the new slippage model to establish the New, Truthful Baseline.

[ ] Acknowledge & Defer: Formally acknowledge that survivorship bias is an unaddressed issue. (Task deferred until pre-deployment).

Phase 1: Implement Core Risk Architecture & Diagnostics
Objective: Immediately control portfolio-level risk and establish the tools needed for data-driven optimization.

[ ] Implement Portfolio-Level Circuit Breakers:

[ ] Max Open Positions: Code a hard limit on concurrent open positions (e.g., 3-5).

[ ] Daily Drawdown Limit: Implement a portfolio-wide "kill switch" that halts new entries for the day if the daily P&L drops below a set threshold (e.g., -2.5% of equity).

[ ] Implement Systematic Performance Diagnostics: Build the diagnostic logger to compare Golden Benchmark trades to the Hybrid model's actions, identifying key sources of performance leakage.

Phase 2: Sharpen the Alpha & Build Conviction Engine
Objective: Improve the quality of entry signals and create the logic engine for dynamic risk.

[ ] Implement Adaptive Volume Velocity Filter: Integrate the filter that compares current 15-min volume to the 70th percentile for that specific time slot, with a multiplier that adapts to the VIX.

[ ] Implement Intraday Relative Strength Compass: Integrate the filter that calculates the real-time performance spread against the Nifty 200 from the pre-market high.

[ ] Develop the Composite Signal Conviction Score: Create a function that generates a single numerical score representing the quality of a setup based on all active filters.

Phase 3: Implement Dynamic Risk & Advanced Filters
Objective: Link capital allocation directly to signal quality and add further layers of confirmation.

[ ] Implement Dynamic Position Sizing: Replace the fixed-risk model. Use the Composite Signal Conviction Score from Phase 2 to dynamically adjust the percentage of capital risked on each trade.

[ ] Add Advanced Confirmation Filters:

[ ] Multi-Timeframe (MTF) Confirmation: Add the Daily -> Hourly -> 15-Min alignment check.

[ ] Market Breadth Filter: Add the real-time Advance/Decline ratio check.

Phase 4: The Final Frontier (Predictive Modeling)
Objective: Bridge the final performance gap to the benchmark using advanced, data-driven techniques.

[ ] Develop the Predictive ML Filter: Train a GradientBoostingClassifier to predict the probability of a setup passing the benchmark's EOD filters.

[ ] Develop "Second Chance" Protocol: Code and test the protocol to intelligently re-enter valid setups that were missed on the initial breakout.
