Hi, I would like to continue working on a Python project. I have attached all the relevant script and data files for full context. Please refer to these attachments to understand the current state of the codebase.

### 1. Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to automate the process of identifying potential long-only trading setups in the Nifty 200 stocks. This is achieved through a suite of Python scripts that handle data acquisition, processing, analysis, and reporting.

### 2. Project Workflow

The project follows a specific, sequential workflow. The scripts are designed to be run in this order:

1.  **`fyers_equity_scraper.py`**: This is the first step. It connects to the Fyers API to download and maintain a local database of daily historical stock data. It intelligently fetches only new data since the last run.
2.  **`resample_data.py`**: This script takes the raw daily data from the previous step and generates aggregated weekly and monthly data, creating a multi-timeframe dataset.
3.  **`calculate_indicators.py`**: This script processes all three sets of data (daily, weekly, monthly) to calculate and add common technical indicators (like EMAs, RSI, MACD, etc.) to each data file.
4.  **`trading_setup_scanner.py`**: This is the final analysis step. It scans all the indicator-rich data files and identifies stocks that meet specific, predefined trading setup rules, saving the results to a report file.

### 3. Environment and Dependencies

-   **Virtual Environment**: The project is set up within a Python virtual environment located at `.venv/`.
-   **Key Libraries**: The following specific libraries are installed and should be assumed to be present:
    -   `fyers-apiv3`
    -   `pandas`
    -   `pandas-ta`
    -   `numpy==1.26.4` (This specific version is used to ensure compatibility with `pandas-ta`).

### 4. Core Components & Attached Files

-   **`fyers_equity_scraper.py`**: The main data scraper. It handles Fyers API authentication (generating `auth_code` and `access_token`), batch-downloads data in 6-month chunks to respect API limits, and performs incremental updates.
-   **`resample_data.py`**: The data processing script for creating weekly and monthly data.
-   **`calculate_indicators.py`**: The analysis script for adding technical indicators.
-   **`trading_setup_scanner.py`**: The final scanner script that identifies and reports trading setups.
-   **`config.py`**: A separate configuration file for storing sensitive API credentials (`CLIENT_ID`, `SECRET_KEY`, `REDIRECT_URI`).
-   **`nifty200.csv`**: A CSV file containing the list of stock symbols to be processed.

### 5. Generated Artifacts (Output)

The scripts create and manage the following directory structure:

-   `historical_data/`: Contains the raw daily OHLCV data.
-   `weekly_data/` & `monthly_data/`: Contain the resampled data.
-   `daily_with_indicators/`, `weekly_with_indicators/`, `monthly_with_indicators/`: Contain the final datasets enriched with technical indicators.
-   `trading_setups_[timestamp].csv`: The final output report file generated by the scanner.

Please assume this entire context and codebase. Do not suggest refactoring the existing code or re-installing dependencies unless it is directly related to the new request.

**(Please add your next goal here...)**
