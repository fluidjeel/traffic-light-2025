Future Vision: The Refined Strategic Roadmap
With the backtesting framework now robust and bias-free for all intended timeframes, the project will proceed with the formal strategic roadmap. The focus is on implementing the features from the following phases to systematically improve CAGR and reduce drawdown.

Phase 0: Foundational Validation & Refinement
Objective: Solidify the integrity of the backtesting framework and establish a data-driven baseline for all future enhancements.

Tasks:

Complete Subset Validation for Daily Strategy: Systematically validate that the simulator_daily_hybrid.py script is a true subset of its corresponding benchmark, resolving any discrepancies to ensure logical consistency.

Finalize HTF 'Immediate' Entry Logic: Enhance the simulator_htf_scout_sniper.py script to refine the rules for what constitutes a valid "immediate" entry, ensuring the logic is robust and aligns with the strategy's core principles.

Conduct Parameter Sensitivity Analysis: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the all_setups_log.csv files to identify the most impactful strategy parameters (e.g., EMA periods, RS lookbacks) and optimize them for the baseline strategy.

Perform Final Lookahead Bias Audit: Conduct a final, manual, and code-assisted review of both simulator scripts to re-verify that no sources of lookahead bias exist before proceeding with new feature development.

Phase 1: Implement Core Risk Architecture & Diagnostics
Objective: Immediately control portfolio-level risk and establish the tools needed for data-driven optimization.

Tasks:

Implement Portfolio-Level Circuit Breakers.

Implement Systematic Performance Diagnostics.

Phase 2: Sharpen the Alpha & Build Conviction Engine
Objective: Improve the quality of entry signals and create the logic engine for dynamic risk.

Tasks:

Implement Adaptive Volume Velocity Filter.

Implement Intraday Relative Strength Compass.

Develop the Composite Signal Conviction Score.

Phase 3: Implement Dynamic Risk & Advanced Filters
Objective: Link capital allocation directly to signal quality and add further layers of confirmation.

Tasks:

Implement Dynamic Position Sizing.

Add Advanced Confirmation Filters (MTF, Market Breadth).

Phase 4: The Final Frontier (Predictive Modeling)
Objective: Bridge the final performance gap to the benchmark using advanced, data-driven techniques.

Tasks:

Develop the Predictive ML Filter.

Develop "Second Chance" Protocol.
